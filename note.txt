to load data into json object:
data = json.loads(zlib.decompress(base64.b64decode(j['blob'])).decode())

(Do we need to figure out how to put mods in the list?)

to get link:
'l,' + x.link_id + ',' + x.id

(different with links obviously)

other fields:
w: probably the same every time
m: number corresponding to mod. need to update the list where needed maybe (unless we can just manually pre-populate)
n: might be the same as well. simple enough at any rate
t: time, need to figure out time zone considerations
